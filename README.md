# My Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It showcases my skills, projects, resume, and a collection of interactive tools. The site is built using HTML, CSS (with SCSS and Bootstrap), and JavaScript, and includes several open-source libraries for enhanced UI and UX.

## Features

- **Modern Responsive Design**: Built with SCSS and Bootstrap for a clean, mobile-friendly layout.
- **Interactive Tools**: Includes a dedicated "My Tools" page with custom utilities and beautiful card-based UI.
- **Animations & Effects**: Uses libraries like WOW.js, Isotope, and Owl Carousel for smooth animations and filtering.
- **Resume Download**: Easily accessible resume in PDF format.
- **Image Gallery**: Showcases portfolio images and testimonials.
- **API Integration**: Backend API (Python) for dynamic features (see `api/api.py`).
